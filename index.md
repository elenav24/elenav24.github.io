### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    For lab 5, part 3, I enjoyed figuring out how to create the code for a blackjack game. It helped me visualize how the code I write can be applied to real-world programs. I also learned how to account for a variety of different inputs.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was my favorite lab assignment this semester. I enjoyed learning how to write code to produce a text animation within the terminal. I learned how to read the contents of a file within the code, too.

* Lab 10

    For lab 10, part 2, I enjoyed learning how to separate code into different functions and classes. I learned what specifically goes into the main function. I also learned how to manage a 2D vector containing many elements.
